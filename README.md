# My [NEOVIM](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) configurations
For everything to work properly, you need to install the following packages.

> [!NOTE]
> The way you install them will depend on your linux distribution. Since I use Archlinux, I'll use pacman.

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu --noconfirm --needed fg bd ripgrep unzip nodejs
```
